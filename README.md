## Force-Controlled Robotic Mechanochemical Synthesis
This repo is support page of Force-Controlled Robotic Mechanochemical Synthesis.
This page provides the Rietveld analysis results, scripts for robotic operation, and files for experimental setup related to the paper on Force-Controlled Robotic Mechanochemical Synthesis.

## Rietveld Analysis
The automated analysis method utilizes BBO-Rietveld.
https://github.com/quantumbeam/BBO-Rietveld
This repository includes demo scripts. 
Please refer to the [README](./BBO-Rietveld/README.md) for instructions on how to use them.


## Scripts for Robotic Powder Grinding
This repository provides the minimal scripts necessary for the experiments described in the paper. 
Please refer to the [README](./BBO-Rietveld/README.md) for instructions on how to use them.


## 3D print soft jig
We provide CAD files for fixtures that can be 3D printed and assembly instructions necessary to replicate the experiments.
Please see [README](./soft_jig/README.md) to construct the soft jig.
